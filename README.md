# Image-Morphing---Delaunay-Triangulation
Morphing one image to the other using delaunay triangulation 

Steps to run the code:

There are two ways you can run the code.

We used Jupyter Notebook as our python ide for this project, which
saves the file in a different extension - 'filename.ipynb'.

If you have Jupyter notebook installed then you can either run the 
"morphing_project_commented.ipynb" file or normally run the python file
"morphing_project_commented.py" file which are both included in this zip file.

Remeber to keep the "Bush.jpg","Clinton.jpg" and the python script you will be
running in the same folder to get the desired output.

We chose 100 frames and 3 control points for our testing.
